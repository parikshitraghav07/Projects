also controlling the thoughts of all the competing characters tangled up in the battle for the &quot;key&quot;.  in a way, it&#39;s suggested that you yourself could be a secret agent and don&#39;t even know it, because the entity could be using you along the way of its goal.  so, the sexy brunette lady in this movie finds herself not only drawn in but ultimately asks to join the secret program,
